# Bambu Power Board

This is a custom power distribution board I designed to extend 24V power from the Bambu Labs X1C.  

## Features  
- **2× Molex Micro-Fit connectors**  
  - One connects to the printer to receive 24V power.  
  - The second connects to the AMS Buffer device (or similar peripherals).  
- **1× Terminal block**  
  - Provides 24V output to any device of your choice (e.g., I use it to power a Bento Box).

# Enclosure

While I’m not a professional 3D modeler, I created a simple enclosure for the board. You're welcome to design your own version and share it with the community.  

The shell includes a mounting hole for an M2 screw, allowing it to be attached to the back of the printer. Alternatively, adhesive strips like Command™ strips can be used for installation.

> ⚠️ **Important:** An enclosure is required when using this board. Operating it without one may result in electrical shorts and serious damage to your printer.

# Ordering

The PCB can be ordered through PCBWay or your preferred fabrication service. PCBWay offers optional assembly services if you’re unable to solder the board yourself. I receive a small referral bonus if you order through them.

A limited number of assembled boards will also be available through my Ko-fi page.
