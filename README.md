# Bambu Power
This is a board I designed to extend 24V power from the Bambu Labs X1C. 

The board has thes options:
2x Molex Micro-Fit connectors(One is used for providing power from the printer and the other is used for the AMS filament buffer device)
1x Terminal block (Used to provide 24V power to whatever device you want, in my case I use it for my Bento Box)

# Shell
I'm not a 3D modeler by any means, so I made a super basic shell for the board. You are more than welcome to design your own and share it if you want. There is a hole for mounting it with a M2 screws onto the back of the printer, but you can also used command strips or something else as well.

## Please note that a shell needs to be used because you will short the board and likely damage your printer if you use it without one. ##

# Disclaimer
This will void your warranty from Bambu Labs. There is the risk of destroying and ruining your printer. I am not responsible for any damages or injories that may occur from using this board.

# Ordering
The board can be order from PCBWay or anywhere you choose. PCBWay does have the option of assembly if you are not able to do it yourself. I also get a small kickback from you ordering from there.

I will offer some boardss on my KoFi as well for a short period.



# Bill of Materials & Assembly
You need 2x Molex Micro-Fit connectors and a terminal block to assemble the board and a Micro-Fit cable for running power. You will also need a Bambu Labs AMS cable. I'm using the AMS Buffer cable.
